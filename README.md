# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description
The motivation behind building this project was to create a command-line application for managing a company's employee database. It serves as a practical example of using Node.js, Inquirer for user prompts, MySQL (specifically, mysql2) for database interactions, and structuring the application to handle various tasks related to employees, roles, and departments.

The project was built to provide a hands-on experience in creating a real-world application that interacts with a database. It's not just about fulfilling a homework assignment but rather about applying the skills learned in a meaningful context, where the development of a command-line employee management system can be translated into practical scenarios in professional settings.

It automates the process of adding departments, roles, and employees, viewing their details, and updating employee roles. It can be a useful tool for businesses to streamline their employee data management process.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
